S3-GAME-AI
Project Overview :-

S3-GAME-AI is a rules-based AI system engineered in Java to play a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game against a single player, either human or AI. The project showcases the development of a flexible AI system that can be easily modified through external rule changes.

Key Features :-

Rules-Based AI System: A Java-based AI system designed to play RTS games against human or AI opponents.
Rule Base Algorithm: Allows for code-independent alteration of rules from an external text file, enabling easy modification of game rules.
Randomized Map Generation: Utilizes Kruskal's algorithm and Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) to generate randomized maps for the game.

Technologies Used :-

Java: Primary programming language for the AI system.
Kruskal's Algorithm: Used for generating randomized maps.
Java API for XML Processing (JAXP): Utilized for parsing and processing XML data.

Setup and Installation :-

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Java is installed and configured on your system.
Run the AI system using the provided Java files.

Usage :-

Modify the external rule file to change game rules.
Run the AI system against a human or AI opponent.
Generate new randomized maps using Kruskal's algorithm.

Acknowledgments :-

This project was developed as a personal endeavor to explore the development of AI systems for strategy games. The experience gained from this project has been invaluable in understanding the complexities of game development and AI systems.
